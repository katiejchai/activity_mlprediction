# Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises, Machine Learning Predictions

The analysis detailed in this report is based on a study investigating the human activity recognition data of participants performing different executions of weightlifting, [Qualitative Activity Recognition of Weight Lifting Exercises](<http://web.archive.org/web/20170519033209/http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/public/papers/2013.Velloso.QAR-WLE.pdf>).

The goal of this report is to predict the qualitative class of weightlifting performed by a subject based on a variety of quantitative features, measured by accelerometers attached to different points of the subjects' bodies.
